# Foundations

Foundations are the building blocks of the design system. They define the core visual language and principles.

- **Shadows** - Elevation and depth system
- **Borders** - Border styles and radius values
- **Transitions** - Animation and transition timing
- **Icons** - Icon system and usage

## Usage

Foundations are applied through the theme system and should be used consistently across all components and patterns.
