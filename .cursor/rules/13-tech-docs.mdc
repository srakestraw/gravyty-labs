# Technical Documentation

## Location

- Architecture: `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/architecture.md`
- APIs: `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/apis.md`
- Data models: `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/data.md`
- Runbooks: `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/runbooks.md`
- ADRs: `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/decisions/ADR-XXX.md` or `docs/tech/decisions/ADR-XXX.md`

## Required Content

Technical documentation must include:

- **Architecture**: System design, component relationships, data flow
- **APIs**: Endpoints, request/response shapes, authentication, rate limits
- **Data**: Data models, schemas, relationships, constraints
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures, troubleshooting, deployment
- **ADRs**: Architecture decisions with context, alternatives considered, consequences

## Update Triggers

Update tech docs when:
- API contracts change (endpoints, request/response shapes)
- Data models change (schemas, relationships, constraints)
- Architecture changes (new components, changed relationships)
- Operational procedures change (deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting)
- Architecture decisions are made (create ADR)

## Linking Requirements

- Link to product requirements: `docs/product/domains/<domain>/requirements/<feature>.md`
- Link to design flows: `docs/design/domains/<domain>/ia-and-flows.md`
- Link to shared services: `docs/shared-services/<service>/README.md`
- Reference contracts: `docs/shared-services/<service>/contracts.md`
