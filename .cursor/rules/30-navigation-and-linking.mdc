# Navigation and Linking

## README Requirements

Every directory README under `docs/` must include:

### Required Sections

1. **Purpose**: What this directory contains
2. **Audience**: Who should read this
3. **Navigation Links**:
   - Link up to parent directory README
   - Link down to child directory READMEs
   - Link to related areas (product ↔ design ↔ tech for same domain)

### Domain READMEs

Domain READMEs (`docs/product/domains/<domain>/README.md`, etc.) must:
- Link to sibling domains (product, design, tech) for the same domain
- Link to shared services used by the domain
- Include "Where do I put this?" guidance for domain-specific docs

### Shared Service READMEs

Shared service READMEs (`docs/shared-services/<service>/README.md`) must:
- Link to domains that use the service
- Link to related shared services
- Include contracts, APIs, and runbooks links

## No Duplication Rule

- **DO NOT** copy content from shared services into domain docs
- **DO** link to shared service docs
- **DO NOT** duplicate API contracts or runbooks
- **DO** document domain-specific usage patterns only

## Cross-References

When referencing:
- **Product requirements** → Link to `docs/product/domains/<domain>/requirements/<feature>.md`
- **Design flows** → Link to `docs/design/domains/<domain>/ia-and-flows.md`
- **Technical architecture** → Link to `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/architecture.md`
- **Shared services** → Link to `docs/shared-services/<service>/README.md`
- **ADRs** → Link to `docs/tech/decisions/ADR-XXX.md` or `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/decisions/ADR-XXX.md`

## Root README

`docs/README.md` must include:
- "Where do I put this?" section
- Domain index (all domains with links)
- Shared service index (all services with links)
- Common tasks and PR checklist
- Quick links to major sections
