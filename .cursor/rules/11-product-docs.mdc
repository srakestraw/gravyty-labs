# Product Documentation

## Location

- Product requirements: `docs/product/domains/<domain>/requirements/<feature>.md`
- Domain context: `docs/product/domains/<domain>/context.md`
- Domain overview: `docs/product/domains/<domain>/README.md`

## Quality Bar

Product documentation must include:

- **Outcomes**: What success looks like (not just features)
- **Metrics**: How we measure success (KPIs, user metrics)
- **User stories**: Who benefits and why
- **Acceptance criteria**: Clear definition of done
- **Dependencies**: Links to design flows and technical architecture

## Update Triggers

Update product docs when:
- Feature behavior changes
- Success metrics change
- User flows change (also update design docs)
- Business rules change

## Linking Requirements

- Link to related design flows: `docs/design/domains/<domain>/ia-and-flows.md`
- Link to technical architecture: `docs/tech/domains/<domain>/architecture.md`
- Link to shared services used: `docs/shared-services/<service>/README.md`
